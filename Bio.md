- 👋 Hi, I’m @MingMing42hours
- 👀 I’m interested in computational neuroscience, systems engineering, categorical cybernetics, scientific computing, climate simulation, and philosophy of science and technology, privacy-preserving brain-computer interfaces, recursive semiotics, computational metaphysics, population genetics, origin of life, fungal biotech, religion and cliodynamics, open science communities like EleutherAI and Afiq Hatta's Independent Physicists.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning free energy principle/active inference, Bayesian formal epistemology, Markov blankets, persistent homology network analysis, agent-based models, longevity escape velocity and its economics, and AGI accelerationism. I am working on edX courses on CS and ML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on science club and technical science careers adjacent to CS. I am open to any business offers and game dev concepts.
- 📫 Reach me on Lesswrong, Manifold, Huggingface, LI, E-Mail, and Discord.
- 💡Political views: Life-extensionist, posthumanist Sinofuturist (Yuk Hui, Jiang Shigong), Bayesian-Technocracy (Information-Credits exemplified by Exergy-Tokens, radical-atheism (ideas from Mainlander, Schmid, Fodor, Kurzweil, Silva, Land, Chardin, and Huxley), post-Deleuzianism, methodological anarchist, ACP and PRC accelerator. Extropian, anti-Singularitarian, anti-hedonistic utilitarian (David Pearce), anti-simulationist (refutation of Bostrom's trichotomy), U/Acc (Unconditional-Accelerationism) or "Old-Land". Anti-regulatory capture. DAOs and FROs will guide towards a cybernetic theory of human organization itself. Neo-China arrives from the future. Vaccine for Future Shock.

- ⚡ Fun facts about me: Carl Sagan and Richard Feynman inspires me. Met a computational neuroscientist studying neural correlates of consciousness at the Goethe-Institut and delegate in the UN AI event. Currently co-managing a Transhumanist forum with Joshua Habka. Went to Sam Donegan's MLAI comps.
